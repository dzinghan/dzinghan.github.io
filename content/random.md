## Fun Facts
<!-- I love bears such as Rilakkuma, Brown from LINE Friends, and Kumamon. -->

<!-- My favorite games are *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* and *Super Mario Odyssey*. I'm currently playing *Luigi's Mansion 3* and *Kirby and the Forgotten Land*.  -->
I was born in Beijing but I've been living in Montreal for more than 15 years. 

My MBTI personality is ISTP. (it might change idk)

I love Nintendo games and often play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in my free time (I got 3 stars in every cup in every speed and I like playing online).

Food is good, good is food.

Late night driving is my comfort.

## Travel
You can shoot me a message to talk about travels. I've been to many places and love tasting local cuisine, visiting attractions, and getting a taste of the world, from going on solo trips to simply visiting my extended family in Beijing. I've been to 21 countries so far, but I somehow still miss 10 islands on the world geography country quiz :)
