## Fun Stuff
I love bears such as Rilakkuma, Brown from LINE Friends, and Kumamon.

My favorite games are *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* and *Super Mario Odyssey*. I'm currently playing *Luigi's Mansion 3* and *Kirby and the Forgotten Land*. 

My MBTI personality is ISTP-T.

## Travel
You can contact me to discuss about solo female travelling, travel tips, or just to ask for my attraction databases (Western/Central Europe and Japan for now). I love keeping track of places I've visited on a trip to help my friends out. 

My favorite cities so far are Tokyo, Rome, and my hometown Beijing.
