## A bit more about me
<!-- I love bears such as Rilakkuma, Brown from LINE Friends, and Kumamon. -->

<!-- My favorite games are *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* and *Super Mario Odyssey*. I'm currently playing *Luigi's Mansion 3* and *Kirby and the Forgotten Land*.  -->
I was born in Beijing but I've been living in Montreal for more than 15 years. When someone asks me where I'm from, I would usually say Montreal. 
<!-- however, people always recognize my beijing dialect when i speak chinese -->

I love Nintendo games and often play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in my free time (I got 3 stars in every cup in every speed -- I like playing online too). I also completed (100%) Super Mario Odyssey and Mario 64.

## travel
You can shoot me a message to talk about travels. I love tasting local cuisine, visiting attractions, and experiencing new cultures, from going on solo trips to simply visiting my extended family. I've been to 21 countries so far (hopefully 25 before 25!)
