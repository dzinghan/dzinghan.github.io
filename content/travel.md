<!-- I love discovering what the world has to offer! I went on several solo trips, including my first time in Europe at 16. 

Happy to talk about travels! (15 countries and counting)

(I will post some pictures, itineraries, and solo travel advice soon)

# Travel Databases

I love keeping track of places I've visited on a trip to help my friends out. You can contact me to discuss about solo female travelling, travel tips, or just to ask for my attraction databases (Western/Central Europe and Japan for now).
